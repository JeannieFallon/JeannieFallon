## Hello, World! ðŸª·

Iâ€™m a software and systems engineer focused on infrastructure, automation, and building reliable tools for AI/ML workflows.

I develop full-stack applications, design containerized environments, and write automation that bridges development and operations. With 8 years of industry experience and a background in education, I bring both technical depth and clear communication to complex problems.

Currently finishing a BS in Computer Science to complement my BA in English and Education.
