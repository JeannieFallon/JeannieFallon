## Hello, World! ðŸª·

I'm a software engineer with a background in education, a mind wired for systems, and a drive to build.

Over the past eight years in the tech industry, Iâ€™ve built software in multiple languages, debugged production systems, and 
translated complex infrastructure into clear, reproducible workflows. Prior to that, I held jobs across a range 
of industries, including high school English teacher, cocktail waitress, and deckhand on a commercial fishing boat. My path 
in computer science began over a decade ago as a side quest at my kitchen table with an old college laptop. Through 
a journey fueled by grit, late-night problem solving, and a relentless appetite for learning, I turned that side quest into 
a full-time career. 

These days, Iâ€™m focused on infrastructure and automation for AI/ML systems, and always dreaming about the next app to build! 
To complement my academic background in English and education, Iâ€™m currently pursuing a CS degree with a concentration 
in AI/ML to prepare for building the systems of tomorrow.
